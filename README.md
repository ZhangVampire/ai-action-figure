## 1. Introduction

With the rapid development of generative AI, the creation of virtual characters has reached unprecedented heights. Action figures, as virtual images combining visual art and personality settings, can be widely used in game development, digital collections, brand merchandise, and social media content creation. The GPT-4o model, combining language and visual processing capabilities, provides a new approach to generating AI action figures.

## 2. What is an AI Action Figure?

AI action figures are virtual characters generated through AI models that possess character backgrounds, physical characteristics, and visualized poses. They not only have unique visual styles but can also be customized in terms of appearance, equipment, poses, personality, and even background stories.

## 3. Advantages of Using GPT-4o

GPT-4o is OpenAI's latest generation multimodal large model with the following features:

- **Language and Image Interaction**: Can understand and generate image descriptions (Prompts), and even generate images (through API or in combination with image generation models).
- **Stronger Context Understanding**: Better at maintaining character consistency and setting details.
- **Superior Natural Language Generation**: Can output high-quality character settings, story backgrounds, and prompt writing suggestions.

## 4. Key Features of Generating AI Action Figures

When generating AI Action Figure images, regardless of the style you choose (realistic, sci-fi, chibi, cute, or fantasy), the following key features can help you define characters more clearly and guide the model to generate ideal images:

- **Character Concept**
Determine the character's identity, such as "future warrior," "mecha girl," "wizard," "tech journalist," or "space explorer," which will determine subsequent styling and accessory combinations.

- **Pose & Expression**
Action figures typically present in fixed poses, requiring specification of body movements and facial expressions, such as "battle stance," "standing salute," "smile," "shouting," etc.

- **Outfit & Accessories**
Based on character settings, describe clothing styles and accessory types (such as weapons, books, microphones, magic wands, backpacks, etc.) to enhance character image completeness.

- **Packaging Style**
Action Figures are often set in transparent packaging boxes. You can add keywords like "blister packaging," "retro toy box," "display box with label" to further enhance the toy effect.

- **Material & Finish**
Action figures typically display plastic, metal, resin, and other material textures. You can specify descriptions like "plastic finish," "shiny vinyl look," "matte armor coating" to simulate real toy textures.

- **Style & Rendering**
You can choose realistic style (photorealistic), 3D rendering (3D render), anime style (anime-style), retro pixel (pixel art), etc., flexibly selecting based on specific creative direction.
